  Pixel art placer for Reddit Place event
<p>

<br>

Official subreddit of the "Reddit Place" event: [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/ "r/place")

<hr>

Works like this:

> You enter an image URL and starting points; the tool then displays the exact coordinates for each pixel, allowing you to click on any pixel to navigate to its corresponding location on the r/place canvas.

<br>

### How to use:

1. Go to --> https://shaanaliyev.github.io/r-placer/
2. **Enter an image url**

   > You need an image URL that has been previously prepared and shared on image hosting platforms such as Imgur, etc.

   > The image URL should end with the correct image format, such as `.png`, `.webp`, etc.

   > To get the correct URL after a successful upload, right-click and choose either "Copy image address" or "Open image in a new tab," then copy the URL.

   > The image you are using should be pixel-perfect sized with the canvas. This means, for example, you cannot use a 1600x1200 image to fit a 25x10 space.

3. **Enter the starting X & Y coordinates**
   > The top left starting points for the image on the canvas.
4. **Click 'generate'**
   > A new workspace URL will be created for you. When you follow the link, the workspace will be ready for placing the image you provided on the r/place canvas. All you have to do is share the link with your community.

<br>

_This is a completely browser-based, client-side application. Therefore, you decide whether the image you provided is working and placed correctly._

### Contributing

> **Warning**:
> I'm about to refactor the project entirely and add extra tools, some functionalities etc. So, currently, only PRs related to critical functionality fixation are allowed.
